# Lane-segmentation-using-Swin-Transformer
This a project about using Swin Transformer complete lane segmention.

In the demo.py, we use different color sign the lane segmention.
In show_result.ipynb, we imported three API functions from the MMDetection library, which are used for model initialization, inference, and result visualization, respectively.
imgs is the testset.
